# Predicting Car Prices

## Introduction

This is a guided project from DataQuest to focus on the fundamentals of machine learning using k-nearest neighbors algorithm. The [data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data) we're working with contains information on various cars. For each car, we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle. This includes the vehicle's motor's displacement, weight of the car, miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more. You can read more about the data set [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile).
